### Note :

- The pages are written in `pug` format and converted to `html` using [script.sh](./script.sh) or [script.bat](./script.bat)

- Before working, You need to install `pug` by typing `npm install pug` in terminal.
    - Only if you do this the below will work

- While working, Just Type `./script.bat` (For Windows) or `./script.sh` (For Linux and MacOS) in Terminal to execute the script files which will convert automatically from `pug` to `html`

- While executing the script leave it open in a Separate terminal as it will watch for new changes in `pug` and instantly convert in to `html` files in real time.
