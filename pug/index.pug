            h2 Why LibRedirect?

            p Normally you watch YouTube videos through <a href="youtube.com">youtube.com</a>'s server. Problem is everything you watch is tied to your Google Account. Even if you didn't use an account, you're IP address is still visible. Even if you used <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, you still have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> enabled, a programming language that can get so much information about your browser and your system it's a little creepy. Just go to <a href="https://deviceinfo.me">deviceinfo.me</a> or <a href="https://www.amiunique.org">amiunique.org</a> and see how much information is available to know about you.<br>
            
            p So, why not disabling JavaScript? Great idea! Now YouTube is broken as it requires JavaScript to function ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

            p There's a way though to make a script that scraps data off of <a href="youtube.com">youtube.com</a> and presents it in a nice simple webpage that doesn't require JavaScript. People have done this already! There's a project called <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a> that doesn't require JavaScript for you to watch YouTube videos, ex: <a href=https://invidious.manerakai.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>https://invidious.manerakai.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
            p Those (Invidious and others) are called alternative <y>Frontends</y>, where you really are still using YouTube but with a different Interface, in our case a privacy friendly one.<br>
                
            p Use an Invidious instance with JavaScript disabled + Tor, and it's almost impossible to know who watched that video.

            p The code for Invidious is open source and you can run it on your own home server or personal computer. People did this already and there's a ton of <a href="https://api.invidious.io/">Instances</a> that are basically servers running Invidious in different parts of the world.
            p Using an instance with multiple people helps to mix your data together as it only exists from one end. It's like using a shared library computer.
            p Using multiple instances (a random one each time) will also mix your data more as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(software)">request logs</a> are now stored in multiple servers rather than in a single centralized one if they happened to store logs in the first place.

            p Using a random instance and changing links each time from ex:<br>
                |<x class="mono"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a> => <a href="https://invidious.manerakai.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://invidious.manerakai.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a></x><br> is a difficult process and best to be automated. Well, we did that!<br>
            
            p LibRedirect's main functionality is to make the use of those instances easier by automating it. It makes life much more easier and privacy more convenient.

            p <a href="./download.html">Download</a> and install it.
            p Type or click on any youtube link you want, ex: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>.<br>
                |It will automatically redirect you to a random Invidious instance. You can fine tune your redirections in the settings page.

            p Same with Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Imgur, TikTok, Google Translate and much more!
